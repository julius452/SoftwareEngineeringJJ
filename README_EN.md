# Ludo - Software Engineering Project

## Description

The project **Ludo** is an implementation of the classic board game that is being developed as part of the Software Engineering course. 
The goal of the project is to learn and apply the principles of agile software development while we implement the functionalities of the game. 
By using code coverage and comprehensive testing, we ensure that the code is of high quality and fulfills all requirements.

## Objective

- **Agile software development**: The project follows agile principles, including iterative development, regular feedback and flexible adaptations to changing requirements.
- **Code Coverage**: We use tools to measure code coverage to ensure that a high percentage of code is covered by tests.
- **Testing**: The project includes unit tests, integration tests and, if necessary, end-to-end tests to ensure the functionality of the game and identify possible errors at an early stage.

## Functions

- **Game board**: Graphical representation of the game board with the players' pieces.
- **Move mechanics**: Players can move their pieces according to the number of dice rolled.
- **Multiplayer**: Support for multiple players (minimum 2, maximum 4).
- **Game rules**: Implementation of the classic rules of the game.
- **Random generator**: A dice system that determines the turn order.
